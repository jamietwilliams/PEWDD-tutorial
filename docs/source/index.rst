PEWDD Documentation
===================================
The Planetary Enriched White Dwarf Database (PEWDD) contains information on the abundances of planetary material accreting onto white dwarfs.
The database will be kept up-to-date as new papers are published. If any white dwarfs that should be in PEWDD are missing, please raise an issue on `Github <https://github.com/jamietwilliams/PEWDD/>`_.
